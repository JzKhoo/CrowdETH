## Motivation

With the rise in entrepreneurship in Singapore, there is an increasing number of individuals who are seeking their own employment and way of life through start-ups.
However, starting such a venture is costly. This is where crowdfunding plays an important role in financing these new business ventures.

Crowdfunding has its merits, but there are some issues with crowdfunding which may deter potential crowd funders from participating.
1. Trust
2. Efficiency
3. Presence of third-parties and the administrative time needed for fund transfers

Crowdfunding will be a **more secure and transparent process** through the use of smart contracts and digitized tokens.

## Vision

**CrowdETH** will be the go-to platform for entrepreneurs and potential funders to connect. The web application harnesses the **unlimited potential of smart contracts** to improve the process of crowdfunding.
